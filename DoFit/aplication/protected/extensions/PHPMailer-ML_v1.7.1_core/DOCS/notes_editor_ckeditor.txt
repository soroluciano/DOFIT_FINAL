NOTE: THE CKEditor and KFM file manager are strictly for use with
      PHP version 5 and up. It will not work with PHP version 4 or lower.

Here is a short tutorial on using CKEditor v3 and  KFM (Kae's File Manager)
with PHPMailer-ML:

CKEditor:
---------

1. Download CKEditor from http://ckeditor.com/

2. Extract the ZIP to your Control Panel in the PHPMailer-ML directory 
   example:
   /phpmailer-ml/_acp-ml/ckeditor

* NOTES: the directory name 'ckeditor' is critical, do not change it
         - there are no other changes required

KFM:
----

1. Download KFM from http://kfm.verens.com/

2. Extract the ZIP to your Control Panel in the PHPMailer-ML directory 
   example:
   /phpmailer-ml/_acp-ml/kfm

3. Open kfm/configuration.dist.php with your text editor and save it as
   kfm/configuration.php

4. Edit kfm/configuration.php:
   - set the database settings to whatever you want or leave as default to
     use sqlite
   - change:
     $kfm_userfiles_address = '/home/youracct/public_html/phpmailer-ml/_acp-ml/user_imgs';
     $kfm_userfiles_output  = '/home/youracct/public_html/phpmailer-ml/_acp-ml/user_imgs/';
   - you need to be aware that the author has written code to track users of
     KFM ... you are free to disable this with:
 		$kfm_dont_send_metrics = 1;
 		and for further protection, you can also edit the file: kfm/index.php
 		- at line 151 to 156 DELETE:
		if (!$kfm_dont_send_metrics) {
			echo '<img src="http://kfm.verens.com/extras/register.php?version='.urlencode(KFM_VERSION).
				'&amp;domain_name='.urlencode($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']).
				'&amp;db_type='.$kfm_db_type.
			'" />';
		}

5. Edit kfm/j/kfm.js
   - change:
		 if(kfm_vars.show_admin_link) hhtml+='<a href="admin/" id="admin_panel_link">Admin panel</a>';
		 comment it out as:
		 //if(kfm_vars.show_admin_link) hhtml+='<a href="admin/" id="admin_panel_link">Admin panel</a>';

6. Delete the directory kfm/admin

7. Create the directory _acp-ml/user_imgs

* NOTES: the directory name 'kfm' is critical, do not change it
         - there are no other changes required

Miscellaneous:
--------------

1. You will need to create a new directory in the root of your PHPMailer-ML
   control panel directory:
   _acp-ml/user_imgs
   and set it to writable
